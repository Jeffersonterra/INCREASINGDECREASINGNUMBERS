#System will tell if the two numbers are in increasing or decreasing order loop
and only stop when two numbers are equal
- Input first number
- Input the second number
- System will print if the two numbers are in increasing or decreasing order
- If the second number is higher then the first system will print increasing
- If the first number is higher then the second system will print decreasing
- System will loop back to the start and only stop when the two numbers are equal
- Enjoy!
